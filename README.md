This is me taking 100 days of ML code challenge!

Day 0:  Before starting off with the 100 days of ML challenge and beginning the apparent "new chapter" in my life of ML, I wanted to clear off the previous one. So I (finally) completed my long procrastinated code for K Means Clustering algorithm which is available at https://github.com/ShreyaGupta08/Machine-Learning-Algorithm-From-Scratch/blob/master/K%20means%20clustering.ipynb 
It didn't take as much time as I had thought it would and I learned two things:
1. It just needed "dedicated" time so instead of spending about 1 hour in front of the screen, even if I give 15 minutes of my "dedicated" time, it did better job and 10 days of procrastination came to an end
2. It was beautiful to see the results and the final transformation into clusters and error being reduced to 0 but its beauty got killed (or significantly reduced) in those 10 days so note-to-self: always complete the things you start at the time time; the longer to extend it, the less its beauty.

Now we can start with the challenge!
