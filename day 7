Today I analysed and completed the tutorial. 

Realisations: 

1. My accuracy was not "that" bad for starters.
2. There was more in-depth attribute analyses to be done than I had done or realised.
3. I should not be afraid of filling up my entire notebook with visualisations and analysis.

Other realisations:

1. I am taking too much time on something that is not my central purpose.

Actions: Come back to NLP.

For tomorrow: Complete movie reviewer.
