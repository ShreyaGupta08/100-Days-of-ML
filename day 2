Day 2:

Considering it was a little hectic day, the majority of the ML-hour was spent looking at how classes are created, initialised and written (for a decision tree, in this case) and failing miserably at understanding the logic behind the code.

So day 2 wouldn't be considered a true day of ML-code but import lesson learnt: Don't keep staring at someone's code. Pick up a marker/pen, a board/page and start visualising what is happening in the code. This way you waste less time staring blankly at the screen and you are able to evaluate whether or not you are able to understand the code you are reading or not. You can go on googling the code if not.

Understanding the code is the first thing after breakfast tomorrow!
